<h1>About Me</h1>
Hello! I'm Nuhaan, a passionate web developer and freelancer. I’m currently learning HTML and building my portfolio website as part of my web development journey. As the founder of Navigatoverse, a freelancing agency specializing in WordPress development, cybersecurity, graphics design, SEO, and social media marketing, I strive to help businesses grow through innovative digital solutions.

I enjoy learning new skills and sharing my knowledge about tech, whether it’s website design, graphics, or optimizing websites for speed and performance. My ultimate goal is to create impactful, user-friendly designs that solve real-world problems.

When I'm not coding or researching, I enjoy gaming, listening to music, and exploring creative ideas to stay inspired.

Let’s connect and build something amazing together!</p>
